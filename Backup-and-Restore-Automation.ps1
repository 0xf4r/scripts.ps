Here's an example of a PowerShell script that automates the backup and restoration processes for Windows Server and Azure resources:

In this script:

1. Set the variables `$backupLocation` and `$backupRetentionDays` to define the backup location on the local machine and the retention period for backups.
2. Set the variables `$azureSubscriptionId` and `$azureResourceGroup` to specify the Azure subscription ID and the resource group containing the Azure VM.
3. Set the variables `$windowsServerName` and `$windowsServerBackupFolder` to specify the Windows Server's name and the folder to be backed up using Windows Server Backup.
4. Set the variable `$azureVmName` to specify the name of the Azure VM to be backed up using Azure Backup.
5. The script creates a backup folder in the specified location with a timestamp.
6. It performs a backup of the Windows Server using the `wbadmin` command-line tool.
7. It enables Azure VM backup using the Azure CLI command `az backup protection enable-for-vm`.
8. The script identifies and deletes old backups based on the defined retention period using `Get-ChildItem` and `Remove-Item` cmdlets.

Make sure to customize the variables with your specific backup locations, Azure credentials, and resource names. Additionally, you may need to install the necessary PowerShell modules (e.g., Azure PowerShell module) and tools (e.g., Azure CLI) for Azure-related operations.

# Set variables for Azure credentials
$azureSubscriptionId = "YourSubscriptionId"
$azureResourceGroup = "YourResourceGroup"

# Set variables for Windows Server backup
$windowsServerName = "YourWindowsServer"
$windowsServerBackupFolder = "C:\WindowsServerBackup"

# Set variables for Azure VM backup
$azureVmName = "YourAzureVM"

# Create backup folder if it doesn't exist
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $backupLocation

# Create a timestamped backup folder
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss"
$backupFolder = Join-Path -Path $backupLocation -ChildPath "Backup_$timestamp"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $backupFolder

# Backup Windows Server using Windows Server Backup
wbadmin start backup -backupTarget:$backupFolder -include:$windowsServerBackupFolder

# Backup Azure VM using Azure Backup
az backup protection enable-for-vm `
  --resource-group $azureResourceGroup `
  --vault-name "YourAzureBackupVault" `
  --vm $azureVmName `

# Delete old backups based on retention period
$oldBackups = Get-ChildItem -Path $backupLocation | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-$backupRetentionDays) }
$oldBackups | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
